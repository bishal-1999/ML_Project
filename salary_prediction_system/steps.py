# steps to perform
"""
1.Huge DataSet
2.Training and Testing
3.Create Regression Line with the help of training data
4.predict y for x test data
5.predict y for new values of x

"""
# algorithm
"""
1.store all the data from csv file in a pandas DataFrame
2.split the data into two parts one is training and another one is testing
3.create ml model with the help of LinearRegression
4.give training data to the model and create a best fit line
5.check your model by giving a testing data
6.print all the predicted test data
7.find the performance of ml model
8.take an input from an user and predict the data
